# Web-based Optimized Journal Search Engine for the College Of Theology Library Using Advanced Web Searching and Optical Character Recognition

This is my thesis during my bachelors degree program and my client was the College of Theology Library.  In this study I programmed a search engine for journals and articles and applied the concepts and theories of Natural Language Processing (Snowball Stemmer) , Machine Learning (K-means Clustering), and Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. I also implemented an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature to scan journals in PDF or image format. I received awards from my university for this work such as Best Thesis Category, Best in Program Design Category, Second Best in Presentation Category and , Best Programmer Award in 2018.
